# Connect Four
This implementation (attempts to) use the [minimax algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax#Minimax_algorithm_with_alternate_moves) with [alpha-beta pruning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning).

The user enters in a number representing the difficulty of the AI. The larger the number, the deeper the algoritm will go to search for a best score for the AI, and a worst score for the human player.

*The implementation can be run but still contains some issues with the minimax algorithm.*

The implementaion was built using Python 3.6.0
